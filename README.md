# Project_5

Project Plan:

Add a new hero class: Dragon.  It will have three abilities: fire breath, bite, and weaponattack.  Fire breath will have the ability to inflict (strength * 0.8) damage points, and bite can inflict (strength * 0.5) damage points.  The weaponattack, which will be the tail slap, will inflict a flat 4 damage.  The new class will contain the appropriate constructor and attack functions.
